### What is the Emporia Vue?

We've covered the Gen 2 model in the [previous video](https://youtu.be/z0Jv4nO9OWg), but in a quick TL;DR.  It's a box that goes in your breaker panel to measure the entire power usage in your home as well as breaking it down to 16 other circuits in your home for a more detailed usage.  This isn't any AI, or guess work involved like other brands, it measures the real world usage of each of the 16 circuits you install the clamps on in the breaker panel. 

Out of the box the unit is cloud only and feeds your data to another company for use!  That's not what we want, it's our electricity usage pattern data!  We want it in house and local! Luckily the Gen 3 contains an ESP32 just like the previous Gen 2 model.

### What is the Gen 3 all about?

**Pay attention to the models**, there are 3 packages with 0, 8, and 16 additional CT clamps included.  

As we stated above, the Gen 3 comes with an ESP32 again and actually the same power monitoring chips. They've only decreased the size in the board itself while changing all 2.5mm/3.5mm CT clamp plugs to Phoenix style plugs.  This means you can now easily cut your CT clamp plugs to length instead of having miles of extra wire to deal with.  Probably a good idea to [crimp ferrules](https://amzn.to/3x2U6Hr) on them again though after you cut them.  

Emporia also added an Ethenet connection, but I'm not comfortable nor do I think my local code allows low voltage to mix with high voltage.  I'll stick to Wi-Fi as the antenna is provided with the punchout plug to stick out of the metal panel.

### Can I put ESPHome on it?

First you'll need to open it as there isn't a known OTA exploit at this time. There are 5 screws on the back.  You'll need to use a BDM frame or solder to the pads on the back.  It isn't that difficult, so pick your poison.  What's a BDM Frame?  [See here](https://digiblur.com/wiki/devices/plugs/wyze_plug_outdoor_wlppo1#how-to-flash-esphome-or-tasmota)

Cossid mapped out the ESP32 RX/TX pins for us below for use with a [USB TTL adapter](https://amzn.to/4903Yz4).  Thanks Cossid!

Keep in mind, do not transpose the RX/TX pins like you normally do.  RX goes to RX and TX goes to TX this time around.

I was able to trace down the I2C pins to the power monitoring chip but the same gen 2 ESPHome code for the sensors should work fine for the new Gen 3 model.  I've included my config below but you can find the ESPHome custom component code at https://github.com/emporia-vue-local/esphome

Note: The config below is missing the Ethernet controller and two LEDs.
