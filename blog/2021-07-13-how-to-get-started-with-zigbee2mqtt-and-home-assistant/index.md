I had so much information and knowledge to a dump on with Zigbee and how I've found the best way to integrate it all with the most reliability, it got split up into two videos.¬† All of the videos are split into chapters so you can easily find the information you need and skip the crap you don't need.¬† There's the install with non-supervisor and supervisor installs as well.¬†¬†
