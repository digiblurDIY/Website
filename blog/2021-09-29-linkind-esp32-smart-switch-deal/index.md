Can we flash Tasmota on it?  **YES!**  The [Linkind Smart Switch](https://amzn.to/3kOLrjx) is rather unique.  It uses an ESP32 chipset, two independent buttons, two independent LEDs (behind the small hole) of green/red and one relay.  It comes with a non branded white screwless decora faceplate.  The switch can also be used in multi-gang boxes as they have the additional mounting holes.
