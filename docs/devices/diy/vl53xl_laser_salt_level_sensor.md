# Water Softener Salt Tank Level Sensor


This project was originally implemented by @jrbwrjr of Discord - thanks Grandpa Jim!

## Build the device
There are lots of ways to built this using various ESP-based boards. I used a C3-based one because it's what I had on hand. If you use something different, you can adjust the GPIO pins accordingly. One such possible setup is using an OG Wemos D1 mini (or clone) and wiring it like this:

## Setup
Prepare your ESPhome device with a standard, base config. No sensors or anything fancy – just get it working. This can vary somewhat depending on your chosen board + ESPhome install  type, and learning how to do it is just part of your ESPHome initiation. If you need help with this, hop on Discord and ask the friendly folks there!

*Protip: If you aren’t already using **secrets**, take a moment to setup your ESPhome ```secrets.yaml``` file so that you can reference them in your config below.*


Once you have the board working and online in ESPhome, push a new config, adapting the below config as necessary to your specific hardware. I have some LED control “switches” in my config as the devboard I used had an onboard RGB LED, so I am using it to show status.

Once the sensor is discovered and populating data in HomeAssistant, you can add a Guage Card to and dashboard to show the level. The "Severity" toggle will let you set ranges:

## GPIO Layout
This is what my GPIO layout was for the ESP-C3-01M-DevKit board I used:

*Note: This particular devboard has an onboard RGB LED, so I used it for a visual status indicator. Without that, the ESPHome config looks much more simple:

```

## Calibrating the range
I found the sensor to be pretty accurate against salt - but a bit more volatile against just a pool of water in the bottom of the brine tank while I was testing.  So, to get my base calibration points I added JUST enough salt in the bottom to bring it above the water line. Measure the distance to top of the tank  (28" in my case). Measure from the top of the tank to where you want your 100% fill to be (8.5" for me) and note both of these values somewhere. Open up the device "Logs" in ESPhome and monitor the salt readings. I took five concurrent readings and averaged them to get my 'zero' measurement in meters. Add another bag of salt, reinstall the lid and take five more measurements, average them and note the average along with the measurement from the top of the tank to your new salt level. Repeat this until you reach your max fill. I ended up with a worksheet like this, which I then translated to percentages based on the ~20" of salt height.
